## Setting Up Proxy for APT
1. To define proxy settings for apt, create or edit (if it already exists) a file named apt.conf in /etc/apt directory:
```shell
sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf
```

2. Add the following lines to the file:
```shell
Acquire::http::Proxy "http://[username]:[password]@ [proxy-web-or-IP-address]:[port-number]";
Acquire::https::Proxy "http://[username]:[password]@ [proxy-web-or-IP-address]:[port-number]";
```

3. Save the file and exit. The configuration will be applied after a reboot.
